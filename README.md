# visualizations
React project that helps visualize the complexity of algorithms, focusing on common software engineering interview questions.

This will be really helpful in teaching Big O of algorithms. I hope to get the visualizations working and then create an API so someone can create a JS function and get a real time visual of the complexity as it runs.
